This is the Debug Items mod. You may be thinking "What even is the use of this mod?" or "Why would I need this?"
Well, whoever needs to make their own mods are in luck! With this mod, you can use all of these items to your heart's content. Things like the Apple of Spirits, the Death Notebook, and MANY more.

My goal with this mod is just to make Mod Developer's lives easier!

Good Luck Modding!
